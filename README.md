# Image Gallery Project

## About the Project

This project is a dynamic image gallery application that fetches and displays high-quality images from the **Unsplash API**. It allows users to browse, search, and view photos seamlessly, with a responsive and modern user interface.

The application was built to showcase the power of integrating third-party APIs with a clean front-end design, providing an intuitive experience for users to explore visual content.

## What It Does

- **Browse Images**: Displays a curated grid of high-resolution images fetched from Unsplash.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for images by keywords, powered by the Unsplash API.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across devices, from desktops to mobiles.
- **Infinite Scroll**: Loads more images as the user scrolls, enhancing performance and user engagement.
- **Image Details**: Users can click on an image to view additional details, such as the photographer's name and description.

## How We Built It

The project was developed using modern web technologies to ensure performance and scalability. We integrated the Unsplash API to fetch images dynamically, requiring an **API key** for authentication.

The front-end was crafted to prioritize user experience, with a focus on clean design and smooth interactions.

## Unsplash API Key

To use the Unsplash API, we registered on the [Unsplash Developer Portal](https://unsplash.com/developers) to obtain an API key. This key is securely stored in an environment variable (`.env`) and used to authenticate API requests.

The API enables the application to retrieve images, search for specific content, and access metadata about each photo.

Example environment variable setup:

```env
VITE_UNSPLASH_API_KEY=your_unsplash_api_key_here

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <[YOUR_GIT_URL](https://github.com/Ashar086/visual-vault-explore.git)>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**
